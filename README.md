# Reproducible research #
A collection of training materials and best practices

## Overview ##
*"Someone unfamiliar with your project should be able to look at your computer files and understand in detail what you did and why. This 'someone' could be any of a variety of people: someone who read your published article and wants to try to reproduce your work, a collaborator who wants to understand the details of your experiments, a future student working in your lab who wants to extend your work after you have moved on to a new job, your research advisor, who may be interested in understanding your work or who may be evaluating your research skills. Most commonly, however, that 'someone' is you"* -[William Stafford Noble](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424)

A guide to organizing data science projects (updated 2018) can be found [here](https://medium.com/outlier-bio-blog/a-quick-guide-to-organizing-data-science-projects-updated-for-2016-4cbb1e6dac71)

Data science projects should be 
1. Versioned with a version-control system (Github)
2. Built with a build management tool (Snakemake, CWL, or WDL)
3. Deployed with a deployment tool (Docker or Singularity)
4. Shared and documented with a browser-based app (JupyterLab or Rnotebook)

### Build management with Snakemake ###
Snakemake follows the GNU Make paradigm: workflows are defined in terms of rules that define how to create output files from input files. Dependencies between the rules are determined automatically, creating a DAG (directed acyclic graph) of jobs that can be automatically parallelized. Snakemake sets itself apart from existing text-based workflow systems in the following way. Hooking into the Python interpreter, Snakemake offers a definition language that is an extension of Python with syntax to define rules and workflow specific properties. This allows to combine the flexibility of a plain scripting language with a pythonic workflow definition. The Python language is known to be concise yet readable and can appear almost like pseudo-code. The syntactic extensions provided by Snakemake maintain this property for the definition of the workflow. Further, Snakemakeâ€™s scheduling algorithm can be constrained by priorities, provided cores and customizable resources and it provides a generic support for distributed computing (e.g., cluster or batch systems). Hence, a Snakemake workflow scales without modification from single core workstations and multi-core servers to cluster or batch systems.
